# CIS-304-Portfolio-Code-1

This program is designed to calculate in-patient and out-patient hospital charges.

The first part of the code lists the variable names and declares what type they are.
The next part deals with in-patients. If you are in-patient, the program asks how many days you spent in the hospital for how much a day. It then asks you for any medication fees and any lab fees or other service fees.
If you are out-patient, the program only asks for your medication fees and lab fees or other service fees.
After receiving the required information, the program calculates a total by adding all of the fees together.
Once calculated, the total charge is shown on the screen.

# CIS-304-Portfolio-Code-1

I have created a program that does the following:
1. Asks the user for input and  returns 'I' or 'O' to indicate in-patient or out-patient.
If a patient was in-patient, allow the user to input the number of days spent in the hospital,
the daily rate, hospital medication charges, and charges for hospital services(lab tests, etc).
If the patient is out-patient, allow the user to input charges for hospital services(lab tests, etc) and
hospital medication charges.
2. Creates a value - returning function named patientCharges that receives all the
charges for in-patient data, calculates the charges and returns only the
totalCharges to main()
3.	Creates another value - returning function named patientCharges  that receives
all the charges for out-patient data, calculates the charges and returns only
the totalCharges to main().
4.	Calls the appropriate function and sends the needed variables to it, depending on whether the status
of the patient was in-patient or out-patient.
5.  Prints out the total charges.
6.	Does not accept any negative numbers for any data.
